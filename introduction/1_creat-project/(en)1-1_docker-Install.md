# Building an Environment
Laravel offers Sail, a built-in solution for running Laravel projects using Docker.  
For this project, we recommend using Sail to get started with Laravel easily.

In this chapter, you will be asked to perform a Docker installation as a prerequisite for the introduction.    
If you have an environment that you can check yourself, please use that.

## Mac
Please follow the installation instructions  
https://docs.docker.jp/docker-for-mac/install.html

## Windows
When installing on Windows, you have two choices. 1.
1. install Docker in WSL2 by yourself
2. to run Docker for Desktop using Hyper-V (or WSL2)

The easier installation is 2. However, smooth development may not be possible due to the performance of the file mount, etc.  
Also, to use Hyper-V, you need to upgrade Windows to Pro.
We recommend using method 1 whenever possible.
